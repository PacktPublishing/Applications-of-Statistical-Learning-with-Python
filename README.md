# Applications of Statistical Learning with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Applications of Statistical Learning with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/applications-statistical-learning-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788295499), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Scientists have been increasingly using Python for data analysis tasks such as natural language processing and computer vision, and a new wave of modules and packages, make programming these tasks easier than ever. In this course, you’ll dive into Natural Language Processing and get familiar with the NLTK package. This video course is filled with real-world, practical examples that show you Python’s true power as a programming language for data analysis.

You’ll learn to read text in documents using different models, and employ sentiment analysis to predict the author’s intent. You’ll also see how to employ Python to read images and for computer vision. Once you’ve learned to employ specific Python packages and syntax for these tasks, you’ll explore case studies that put forth solid real-world examples on spam filtering and analyzing human emotions through a dictionary of images.
