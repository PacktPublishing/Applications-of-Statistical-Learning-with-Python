    "# Looking for Signs: Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "*Curtis Miller*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the machine learning task of assigning a score to a text representing its emotional content. For instance, we may recognize the sentence \"I loved the movie; it had great acting, an excellent cast and the popcorn was delicious!\" as being generated by good emotions, while the sentence \"I hated the movie; it had terrible acting, a subpar cast and the popcorn was disgusting!\" as being generated by negative emotions, and the sentence \"I watched the movie; it had some acting, a large cast and the popcorn was buttery,\" as being emotionally neutral. Our objective with sentiment analysis is to quantify these emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training sentiment analyzers often requires manually annotating words and sentences with sentiment scores and then training an algorithm to predict sentiment using the lexicons and corpora produced this way as data. While we could train our own, and NLTK does provide tools and corpora for doing this, NLTK provides a good sentiment analysis system, [VADER](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf), out of the box. VADER is designed with analyzing social media sentiment in mind, but it is general-purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I prepare the VADER system for our work."
