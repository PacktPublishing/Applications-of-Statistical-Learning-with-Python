Title: Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning Under Uncertainty
Authors: Fatma Faruq, Bruno Lacerda, Nick Hawes and David Parker
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  We propose novel techniques for task allocation and planning in multi-robot
systems operating in uncertain environments. Task allocation is performed
simultaneously with planning, which provides more detailed information about
individual robot behaviour, but also exploits the independence between tasks to
do so efficiently. We use Markov decision processes to model robot behaviour
and linear temporal logic to specify tasks and safety constraints. Building
upon techniques and tools from formal verification, we show how to generate a
sequence of multi-robot policies, iteratively refining them to reallocate tasks
if individual robots fail, and providing probabilistic guarantees on the
performance (and safe operation) of the team of robots under the resulting
policy. We implement our approach and evaluate it on a benchmark multi-robot
example.

Title: A Brandom-ian view of Reinforcement Learning towards strong-AI
Authors: Atrisha Sarkar
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The analytic philosophy of Robert Brandom, based on the ideas of pragmatism,
paints a picture of sapience, through inferentialism. In this paper, we present
a theory, that utilizes essential elements of Brandom's philosophy, towards the
objective of achieving strong-AI. We do this by connecting the constitutive
elements of reinforcement learning and the Game Of Giving and Asking For
Reasons. Further, following Brandom's prescriptive thoughts, we restructure the
popular reinforcement learning algorithm A3C, and show that RL algorithms can
be tuned towards the objective of strong-AI.

Title: SA-IGA: A Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Method Towards Socially
  Optimal Outcomes
Authors: Chengwei Zhang and Xiaohong Li and Jianye Hao and Siqi Chen and Karl
  Tuyls and Wanli Xue
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In multiagent environments, the capability of learning is important for an
agent to behave appropriately in face of unknown opponents and dynamic
environment. From the system designer's perspective, it is desirable if the
agents can learn to coordinate towards socially optimal outcomes, while also
avoiding being exploited by selfish opponents. To this end, we propose a novel
gradient ascent based algorithm (SA-IGA) which augments the basic
gradient-ascent algorithm by incorporating social awareness into the policy
update process. We theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of SA-IGA using
dynamical system theory and SA-IGA is shown to have linear dynamics for a wide
range of games including symmetric games. The learning dynamics of two
representative games (the prisoner's dilemma game and the coordination game)
are analyzed in details. Based on the idea of SA-IGA, we further propose a
practical multiagent learning algorithm, called SA-PGA, based on Q-learning
update rule. Simulation results show that SA-PGA agent can achieve higher
social welfare than previous social-optimality oriented Conditional Joint
Action Learner (CJAL) and also is robust against individually rational
opponents by reaching Nash equilibrium solutions.

Title: Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning
Authors: Drew A. Hudson and Christopher D. Manning
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
\\
  We present the MAC network, a novel fully differentiable neural network
architecture, designed to facilitate explicit and expressive reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from first principles of computer organization, MAC moves away from
monolithic black-box neural architectures towards a design that encourages both
transparency and versatility. The model approaches problems by decomposing them
into a series of attention-based reasoning steps, each performed by a novel
recurrent Memory, Attention, and Composition (MAC) cell that maintains a
separation between control and memory. By stringing the cells together and
imposing structural constraints that regulate their interaction, MAC
effectively learns to perform iterative reasoning processes that are directly
inferred from the data in an end-to-end approach. We demonstrate the model's
strength, robustness and interpretability on the challenging CLEVR dataset for
visual reasoning, achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.9% accuracy, halving the
error rate of the previous best model. More importantly, we show that the model
is computationally-efficient and data-efficient, in particular requiring 5x
less data than existing models to achieve strong results.

Title: Concise Fuzzy Representation of Big Graphs: a Dimensionality Reduction
  Approach
Authors: Faisal N. Abu-Khzam and Rana H. Mouawi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The enormous amount of data to be represented using large graphs exceeds in
some cases the resources of a conventional computer. Edges in particular can
take up a considerable amount of memory as compared to the number of nodes.
However, rigorous edge storage might not always be essential to be able to draw
the needed conclusions. A similar problem takes records with many variables and
attempts to extract the most discernible features. It is said that the
"dimension" of this data is reduced. Following an approach with the same
objective in mind, we can map a graph representation to a k-dimensional space
and answer queries of neighboring nodes by measuring Euclidean distances. The
accuracy of our answers would decrease but would be compensated for by fuzzy
logic which gives an idea about the likelihood of error. This method allows for
reasonable representation in memory while maintaining a fair amount of useful
information. Promising preliminary results are obtained and reported by testing
the proposed approach on a number of Facebook graphs.

Title: Accelerating a fluvial incision and landscape evolution model with
  parallelism
Authors: Richard Barnes
Categories: cs.CE cs.DS
Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Solving inverse problems and achieving statistical rigour in landscape
evolution models requires running many model realizations. Parallel computation
is necessary to achieve this in a reasonable time. However, no previous
algorithm is well-suited to leveraging modern parallelism. Here, I describe an
algorithm that can utilize the parallel potential of GPUs, many-core
processors, and SIMD instructions, in addition to working well in serial. The
new algorithm runs 43x faster (70s vs. 3,000s on a 10,000x10,000 input) than
the previous state of the art and exhibits sublinear scaling with input size. I
also identify methods for using multidirectional flow routing and quickly
eliminating landscape depressions and local minima. Tips for parallelization
and a step-by-step guide to achieving it are given to help others achieve good
performance with their own code. Complete, well-commented, easily adaptable
source code for all versions of the algorithm is available as a supplement and
on Github.

Title: The emergent algebraic structure of RNNs and embeddings in NLP
Authors: Sean A. Cantrell
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 24 pages, 16 figures
MSC-class: 97R40
\\
  We examine the algebraic and geometric properties of a uni-directional GRU
and word embeddings trained end-to-end on a text classification task. A
hyperparameter search over word embedding dimension, GRU hidden dimension, and
a linear combination of the GRU outputs is performed. We conclude that words
naturally embed themselves in a Lie group and that RNNs form a nonlinear
representation of the group. Appealing to these results, we propose a novel
class of recurrent-like neural networks and a word embedding scheme.

Title: An efficient framework for learning sentence representations
Authors: Lajanugen Logeswaran, Honglak Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: ICLR 2018
\\
  In this work we propose a simple and efficient framework for learning
sentence representations from unlabelled data. Drawing inspiration from the
distributional hypothesis and recent work on learning sentence representations,
we reformulate the problem of predicting the context in which a sentence
appears as a classification problem. Given a sentence and its context, a
classifier distinguishes context sentences from other contrastive sentences
based on their vector representations. This allows us to efficiently learn
different types of encoding functions, and we show that the model learns
high-quality sentence representations. We demonstrate that our sentence
representations outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised
representation learning methods on several downstream NLP tasks that involve
understanding sentence semantics while achieving an order of magnitude speedup
in training time.

  In this paper we present a question answering system using a neural network
to interpret questions learned from the DBpedia repository. We train a

Although the automatic evaluation shows a low overlap of the generated answers
compared to the gold standard set, a manual inspection of the showed promising
outcomes from the experiment for further work.

Title: How Images Inspire Poems: Generating Classical Chinese Poetry from
  Images with Memory Networks
Authors: Linli Xu, Liang Jiang, Chuan Qin, Zhe Wang, Dongfang Du
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by AAAI 2018
\\
  With the recent advances of neural models and natural language processing,
automatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has drawn significant
attention due to its artistic and cultural value. Previous works mainly focus
on generating poetry given keywords or other text information, while visual
inspirations for poetry have been rarely explored. Generating poetry from
images is much more challenging than generating poetry from text, since images
contain very rich visual information which cannot be described completely using
several keywords, and a good poem should convey the image accurately. In this
paper, we propose a memory based neural model which exploits images to generate
poems. Specifically, an Encoder-Decoder model with a topic memory network is
proposed to generate classical Chinese poetry from images. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work attempting to generate classical Chinese
poetry from images with neural networks. A comprehensive experimental
investigation with both human evaluation and quantitative analysis demonstrates
that the proposed model can generate poems which convey images accurately.

  Community Question Answering (cQA) forums are very popular nowadays, as they
represent effective means for communities around particular topics to share
information. Unfortunately, this information is not always factual. Thus, here
we explore a new dimension in the context of cQA, which has been ignored so
far: checking the veracity of answers to particular questions in cQA forums. As
this is a new problem, we create a specialized dataset for it. We further
propose a novel multi-faceted model, which captures information from the answer
content (what is said and how), from the author profile (who says it), from the
rest of the community forum (where it is said), and from external authoritative
sources of information (external support). Evaluation results show a MAP value
of 86.54, which is 21 points absolute above the baseline.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to solve dialogue policy
optimisation. Traditional RL algorithms, however, fail to scale to large
domains due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel Dialogue
Management architecture, based on Feudal RL, which decomposes the decision into
two steps; a first step where a master policy selects a subset of primitive
actions, and a second step where a primitive action is chosen from the selected
subset. The structural information included in the domain ontology is used to
abstract the dialogue state space, taking the decisions at each step using
different parts of the abstracted state. This, combined with an information
sharing mechanism between slots, increases the scalability to large domains. We
show that an implementation of this approach, based on Deep-Q Networks,
significantly outperforms previous state of the art in several dialogue domains
and environments, without the need of any additional reward signal.

Title: A framework with updateable joint images re-ranking for Person
  Re-identification
Authors: Mingyue Yuan, Dong Yin, Jingwen Ding, Yuhao Luo, Zhipeng Zhou,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 23 pages,5 figures. submitted to JVCI
\\
  Person re-identification plays an important role in realistic video
surveillance with increasing demand for public safety. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework with rules of updating images for person
re-identification in real-world surveillance system. First, Image Pool is
generated by using mean-shift tracking method to automatically select video
frame fragments of the target person. Second, features extracted from Image
Pool by convolutional network work together to re-rank original ranking list of
the main image and matching results will be generated. In addition, updating
rules are designed for replacing images in Image Pool when a new image
satiating with our updating critical formula in video system. These rules fall
into two categories: if the new image is from the same camera as the previous
updated image, it will replace one of assist images; otherwise, it will replace
the main image directly. Experiments are conduced on Market-1501, iLIDS-VID and
PRID-2011 and our ITSD datasets to validate that our framework outperforms on
rank-1 accuracy and mAP for person re-identification. Furthermore, the update
ability of our framework provides consistently remarkable accuracy rate in
real-world surveillance system.

Title: Instance Similarity Deep Hashing for Multi-Label Image Retrieval
Authors: Zheng Zhang, Qin Zou, Qian Wang, Yuewei Lin, and Qingquan Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Hash coding has been widely used in the approximate nearest neighbor search
for large-scale image retrieval. Recently, many deep hashing methods have been
proposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional
feature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise
similarity on the semantic-level labels, where the pairwise similarity is
generally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is, the pairwise similarity is
'1' if they share no less than one class label and '0' if they do not share
any. However, such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking
for pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper, a new deep
hashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the
pairwise similarity into an instance similarity, where the instance similarity
is quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based
on the instance similarity, a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean
square error loss are tailored for loss-function construction, and are
efficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding. Experiments
on three popular datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method outperforms the
competing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-label
image retrieval.

Title: Rethinking Feature Distribution for Loss Functions in Image
  Classification
Authors: Weitao Wan, Yuanyi Zhong, Tianpeng Li, Jiansheng Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2018 as spotlight
\\
  We propose a large-margin Gaussian Mixture (L-GM) loss for deep neural
networks in classification tasks. Different from the softmax cross-entropy
loss, our proposal is established on the assumption that the deep features of
the training set follow a Gaussian Mixture distribution. By involving a
classification margin and a likelihood regularization, the L-GM loss
facilitates both a high classification performance and an accurate modeling of
the training feature distribution. As such, the L-GM loss is superior to the
softmax loss and its major variants in the sense that besides classification,
it can be readily used to distinguish abnormal inputs, such as the adversarial
examples, based on their features' likelihood to the training feature
distribution. Extensive experiments on various recognition benchmarks like
MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet and LFW, as well as on adversarial examples demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Title: Learning Effective Binary Visual Representations with Deep Networks
Authors: Jianxin Wu and Jian-Hao Luo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Although traditionally binary visual representations are mainly designed to
reduce computational and storage costs in the image retrieval research, this
paper argues that binary visual representations can be applied to large scale
recognition and detection problems in addition to hashing in retrieval.
Furthermore, the binary nature may make it generalize better than its
real-valued counterparts. Existing binary hashing methods are either two-stage
or hinging on loss term regularization or saturated functions, hence converge
slowly and only emit soft binary values. This paper proposes Approximately
Binary Clamping (ABC), which is non-saturating, end-to-end trainable, with fast
convergence and can output true binary visual representations. ABC achieves
comparable accuracy in ImageNet classification as its real-valued counterpart,
and even generalizes better in object detection. On benchmark image retrieval
datasets, ABC also outperforms existing hashing methods.

Title: Robustness of control point configurations for homography and planar
  pose estimation
Authors: Raul Acuna, Volker Willert
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spatial configuration of a
number of $n \geq 4$ control points on the accuracy and robustness of space
resection methods, e.g. used by a fiducial marker for pose estimation. We find
robust configurations of control points by minimizing the first order perturbed
solution of the DLT algorithm which is equivalent to minimizing the condition
number of the data matrix. An empirical statistical evaluation is presented
verifying that these optimized control point configurations not only increase
the performance of the DLT homography estimation but also improve the
performance of planar pose estimation methods like IPPE and EPnP, including the
iterative minimization of the reprojection error which is the most accurate
algorithm. We provide the characteristics of stable control point
configurations for real-world noisy camera data that are practically
independent on the camera pose and form certain symmetric patterns dependent on
the number of points. Finally, we present a comparison of optimized
configuration versus the number of control points.

Title: Preserving Semantic Relations for Zero-Shot Learning
Authors: Yashas Annadani, Soma Biswas
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2018
\\
  Zero-shot learning has gained popularity due to its potential to scale
recognition models without requiring additional training data. This is usually
achieved by associating categories with their semantic information like
attributes. However, we believe that the potential offered by this paradigm is
not yet fully exploited. In this work, we propose to utilize the structure of
the space spanned by the attributes using a set of relations. We devise
objective functions to preserve these relations in the embedding space, thereby
inducing semanticity to the embedding space. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that inducing semanticity
to the embedding space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. The proposed
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the standard zero-shot setting as
well as the more realistic generalized zero-shot setting. We also demonstrate
how the proposed approach can be useful for making approximate semantic
inferences about an image belonging to a category for which attribute
information is not available.

Title: Leveraging Unlabeled Data for Crowd Counting by Learning to Rank
Authors: Xialei Liu, Joost van de Weijer, Andrew D. Bagdanov
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR18
\\
  We propose a novel crowd counting approach that leverages abundantly
available unlabeled crowd imagery in a learning-to-rank framework. To induce a
ranking of cropped images , we use the observation that any sub-image of a
crowded scene image is guaranteed to contain the same number or fewer persons
than the super-image. This allows us to address the problem of limited size of
existing datasets for crowd counting. We collect two crowd scene datasets from
Google using keyword searches and query-by-example image retrieval,
respectively. We demonstrate how to efficiently learn from these unlabeled
datasets by incorporating learning-to-rank in a multi-task network which
simultaneously ranks images and estimates crowd density maps. Experiments on
two of the most challenging crowd counting datasets show that our approach
obtains state-of-the-art results.

Title: Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN for Object Detection in the Wild
Authors: Yuhua Chen, Wen Li, Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, Luc Van Gool
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2018
\\
  Object detection typically assumes that training and test data are drawn from
an identical distribution, which, however, does not always hold in practice.
Such a distribution mismatch will lead to a significant performance drop. In
this work, we aim to improve the cross-domain robustness of object detection.
We tackle the domain shift on two levels: 1) the image-level shift, such as
image style, illumination, etc, and 2) the instance-level shift, such as object
appearance, size, etc. We build our approach based on the recent
state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN model, and design two domain adaptation
components, on image level and instance level, to reduce the domain
discrepancy. The two domain adaptation components are based on H-divergence
theory, and are implemented by learning a domain classifier in adversarial
training manner. The domain classifiers on different levels are further
reinforced with a consistency regularization to learn a domain-invariant region
proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model. We evaluate our newly
proposed approach using multiple datasets including Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K,
etc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for
robust object detection in various domain shift scenarios.

Title: Value Alignment, Fair Play, and the Rights of Service Robots
Authors: Daniel Estrada
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Ethics and safety research in artificial intelligence is increasingly framed
in terms of "alignment" with human values and interests. I argue that Turing's
call for "fair play for machines" is an early and often overlooked contribution
to the alignment literature. Turing's appeal to fair play suggests a need to
correct human behavior to accommodate our machines, a surprising inversion of
how value alignment is treated today. Reflections on "fair play" motivate a
novel interpretation of Turing's notorious "imitation game" as a condition not
of intelligence but instead of value alignment: a machine demonstrates a
minimal degree of alignment (with the norms of conversation, for instance) when
it can go undetected when interrogated by a human. I carefully distinguish this
interpretation from the Moral Turing Test, which is not motivated by a
principle of fair play, but instead depends on imitation of human moral
behavior. Finally, I consider how the framework of fair play can be used to
situate the debate over robot rights within the alignment literature. I argue
that extending rights to service robots operating in public spaces is "fair" in
precisely the sense that it encourages an alignment of interests between humans
and machines.

Title: Gerrymandering and Compactness: Implementation Flexibility and Abuse
Authors: Richard Barnes and Justin Solomon
Categories: cs.CY cs.CG
Comments: 10 pages, 17 figures, 1 table
\\
  The shape of an electoral district may suggest whether it was drawn with
political motivations, or gerrymandered. For this reason, quantifying the shape
of districts, in particular their compactness, is a key task in politics and
civil rights. A growing body of literature suggests and analyzes compactness
measures mathematically, but little consideration has been given to how these
scores should be calculated in practice. Here, we consider the effects of a
number of decisions that must be made in interpreting and implementing a set of
popular compactness scores. We show that the choices made in quantifying
compactness may themselves become political tools, with seemingly innocuous
decisions leading to disparate scores. We show that when the full range of
implementation flexibility is used, it can be abused to make clearly
gerrymandered districts appear quantitatively reasonable. This complicates
using compactness as a legislative or judicial standard to counteract unfair
redistricting practices. This paper accompanies the release of packages in C++,
Python, and R which correctly, efficiently, and reproducibly calculate a
variety of compactness scores.

  The Sharing Economy (SE) is a growing ecosystem focusing on peer-to-peer

reputation information. However, how such information impacts user judgement is
still being understood. To explore such effects, we constructed an artificial
SE accommodation platform where we varied the elements related to hosts'
digital identity, measuring users' perceptions and decisions to interact.
Across three studies, we find that trust and reputation information increases
not only the users' perceived trustworthiness, credibility, and sociability of
hosts, but also the propensity to rent a private room in their home. This
effect is seen when providing users both with complete profiles and profiles
with partial user-selected information. Closer investigations reveal that three
elements relating to the host's digital identity are sufficient to produce such
positive perceptions and increased rental decisions, regardless of which three
elements are presented. Our findings have relevant implications for human
judgment and privacy in the SE, and question its current culture of ever
increasing information-sharing.

Title: Satisficing in Time-Sensitive Bandit Learning
Authors: Daniel Russo and Benjamin Van Roy
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: This submission largely supersedes earlier work in arXiv:1704.09028
\\
  Much of the recent literature on bandit learning focuses on algorithms that
aim to converge on an optimal action. One shortcoming is that this orientation
does not account for time sensitivity, which can play a crucial role when
learning an optimal action requires much more information than near-optimal
ones. Indeed, popular approaches such as upper-confidence-bound methods and
Thompson sampling can fare poorly in such situations. We consider instead
learning a satisficing action, which is near-optimal while requiring less
information, and propose satisficing Thompson sampling, an algorithm that
serves this purpose. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret
and study the application of satisficing Thompson sampling to linear and
infinite-armed bandits, demonstrating arbitrarily large benefits over Thompson
sampling. We also discuss the relation between the notion of satisficing and
the theory of rate distortion, which offers guidance on the selection of
satisficing actions.

\\
  During the 2017 NBA playoffs, Celtics coach Brad Stevens was faced with a
difficult decision when defending against the Cavaliers: "Do you double and
risk giving up easy shots, or stay at home and do the best you can?" It's a
tough call, but finding a good defensive strategy that effectively incorporates
doubling can make all the difference in the NBA. In this paper, we analyze
double teaming in the NBA, quantifying the trade-off between risk and reward.
Using player trajectory data pertaining to over 643,000 possessions, we
identified when the ball handler was double teamed. Given these data and the
corresponding outcome (i.e., was the defense successful), we used deep
reinforcement learning to estimate the quality of the defensive actions. We
present qualitative and quantitative results summarizing our learned defensive
strategy for defending. We show that our policy value estimates are predictive
of points per possession and win percentage. Overall, the proposed framework
represents a step toward a more comprehensive understanding of defensive
strategies in the NBA.

Title: A Deep Generative Model for Disentangled Representations of Sequential
  Data
Authors: Yingzhen Li, Stephan Mandt
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  We present a VAE architecture for encoding and generating high dimensional
sequential data, such as video or audio. Our deep generative model learns a
latent representation of the data which is split into a static and dynamic
part, allowing us to approximately disentangle latent time-dependent features
(dynamics) from features which are preserved over time (content). This
architecture gives us partial control over generating content and dynamics by
conditioning on either one of these sets of features. In our experiments on
artificially generated cartoon video clips and voice recordings, we show that
we can convert the content of a given sequence into another one by such content
swapping. For audio, this allows us to convert a male speaker into a female
speaker and vice versa, while for video we can separately manipulate shapes and
dynamics. Furthermore, we give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that
stochastic RNNs as latent state models are more efficient at compressing and
generating long sequences than deterministic ones, which may be relevant for
applications in video compression.

Title: Reptile: a Scalable Metalearning Algorithm
Authors: Alex Nichol, John Schulman
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  This paper considers metalearning problems, where there is a distribution of
tasks, and we would like to obtain an agent that performs well (i.e., learns
quickly) when presented with a previously unseen task sampled from this
distribution. We present a remarkably simple metalearning algorithm called
Reptile, which learns a parameter initialization that can be fine-tuned quickly
on a new task. Reptile works by repeatedly sampling a task, training on it, and
moving the initialization towards the trained weights on that task. Unlike
MAML, which also learns an initialization, Reptile doesn't require
differentiating through the optimization process, making it more suitable for
optimization problems where many update steps are required. We show that
Reptile performs well on some well-established benchmarks for few-shot
classification. We provide some theoretical analysis aimed at understanding why
Reptile works.

Title: Cross-domain Recommendation via Deep Domain Adaptation

Categories: cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  The behavior of users in certain services could be a clue that can be used to
infer their preferences and may be used to make recommendations for other
services they have never used. However, the cross-domain relationships between
items and user consumption patterns are not simple, especially when there are
few or no common users and items across domains. To address this problem, we
propose a content-based cross-domain recommendation method for cold-start users
that does not require user- and item- overlap. We formulate recommendation as
extreme multi-class classification where labels (items) corresponding to the
users are predicted. With this formulation, the problem is reduced to a domain
adaptation setting, in which a classifier trained in the source domain is
adapted to the target domain. For this, we construct a neural network that
combines an architecture for domain adaptation, Domain Separation Network, with
a denoising autoencoder for item representation. We assess the performance of
our approach in experiments on a pair of data sets collected from movie and
news services of Yahoo! JAPAN and show that our approach outperforms several
baseline methods including a cross-domain collaborative filtering method.

Title: Learning with Rules

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Complex classifiers may exhibit "embarassing" failures in cases that would be
easily classified and justified by a human. Avoiding such failures is obviously
paramount, particularly in domains where we cannot accept this unexplained
behavior. In this work, we focus on one such setting, where a label is
perfectly predictable if the input contains certain features, and otherwise, it
is predictable by a linear classifier. We define a related hypothesis class and
determine its sample complexity. We also give evidence that efficient
algorithms cannot, unfortunately, enjoy this sample complexity. We then derive
a simple and efficient algorithm, and also give evidence that its sample
complexity is optimal, among efficient algorithms. Experiments on sentiment
analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the method, both in terms of accuracy and
interpretability.

Title: Fairness Through Computationally-Bounded Awareness
Authors: Michael P. Kim and Omer Reingold and Guy N. Rothblum
Categories: cs.LG cs.CC cs.DS
\\
  We study the problem of fair classification within the versatile framework of
Dwork et al. [ITCS 2012], which assumes the existence of a metric that measures
similarity between pairs of individuals. Unlike previous works on metric-based
fairness, we do not assume that the entire metric is known to the learning
algorithm. Instead, we study the setting where a learning algorithm can query
this metric a bounded number of times to ascertain similarities between
particular pairs of individuals. For example, the queries might be answered by
a panel of specialists spanning social scientists, statisticians, demographers,
and ethicists.
  We propose "metric multifairness," a new definition of fairness that is
parameterized by a similarity metric $\delta$ on pairs of individuals and a
collection ${\cal C}$ of"comparison sets" over pairs of individuals. One way to
view this collection is as the family of comparisons that can be expressed
within some computational bound. With this interpretation, metric
multifairnesss loosely guarantees that similar subpopulations are treated
similarly, as long as these subpopulations can be identified within this bound.
In particular, metric multifairness implies that a rich class of subpopulations
are protected from a multitude of discriminatory behaviors.
  We provide a general-purpose framework for learning a metric multifair
hypothesis that achieves near-optimal loss from a small number of random
samples from the metric $\delta$. We study the sample complexity and time
complexity of learning a metric multifair hypothesis (providing rather tight
upper and lower bounds) by connecting it to the task of learning the class
${\cal C}$. In particular, if the class ${\cal C}$ admits an efficient agnostic
learner, then we can learn such a metric multifair hypothesis efficiently.

Title: Efficient Algorithms for Outlier-Robust Regression
Authors: Adam Klivans and Pravesh K. Kothari and Raghu Meka
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DS stat.ML
Comments: 28 pages
\\
  We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for performing linear or
polynomial regression resilient to adversarial corruptions in both examples and
labels.
  Given a sufficiently large (polynomial-size) training set drawn i.i.d. from
distribution D and subsequently corrupted on some fraction of points, our
algorithm outputs a linear function whose squared error is close to the squared
error of the best-fitting linear function with respect to D, assuming that the
marginal distribution of D over the input space is \emph{certifiably
hypercontractive}. This natural property is satisfied by many well-studied
distributions such as Gaussian, strongly log-concave distributions and, uniform
distribution on the hypercube among others. We also give a simple statistical
lower bound showing that some distributional assumption is necessary to succeed
in this setting.
  These results are the first of their kind and were not known to be even
information-theoretically possible prior to our work.
  Our approach is based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) method and is inspired by
the recent applications of the method for parameter recovery problems in
unsupervised learning. Our algorithm can be seen as a natural convex relaxation
of the following conceptually simple non-convex optimization problem: find a
linear function and a large subset of the input corrupted sample such that the
least squares loss of the function over the subset is minimized over all
possible large subsets.

Title: Probably Approximately Metric-Fair Learning
Authors: Guy N. Rothblum and Gal Yona
Categories: cs.LG cs.DS
\\
  We study fairness in machine learning. A learning algorithm, given a training
set drawn from an underlying population, learns a classifier that will be used
to make decisions about individuals. The concern is that this classifier's
decisions might be discriminatory, favoring certain subpopulations over others.
The seminal work of Dwork et al. [ITCS 2012] introduced fairness through
awareness, positing that a fair classifier should treat similar individuals
similarly. Similarity between individuals is measured by a task-specific
similarity metric. In the context of machine learning, however, this fairness
notion faces serious difficulties, as it does not generalize and can be
computationally intractable.
  We introduce a relaxed notion of approximate metric-fairness, which allows a
small fairness error: for a random pair of individuals sampled from the
population, with all but a small probability of error, if they are similar then
they are treated similarly. In particular, this provides
discrimination-protections to every subpopulation that is not too small. We
show that approximate metric-fairness does generalize from a training set to
the underlying population, and we leverage these generalization guarantees to
construct polynomial-time learning algorithms that achieve competitive accuracy
subject to fairness constraints.

  Adjusting the learning rate schedule in stochastic gradient methods is an
important unresolved problem which requires tuning in practice. If certain
parameters of the loss function such as smoothness or strong convexity
constants are known, theoretical learning rate schedules can be applied.
However, in practice, such parameters are not known, and the loss function of
interest is not convex in any case. The recently proposed batch normalization
reparametrization is widely adopted in most neural network architectures today
because, among other advantages, it is robust to the choice of Lipschitz
constant of the gradient in loss function, allowing one to set a large learning
rate without worry. Inspired by batch normalization, we propose a general
nonlinear update rule for the learning rate in batch and stochastic gradient
descent so that the learning rate can be initialized at a high value, and is
subsequently decreased according to gradient observations along the way. The
proposed method is shown to achieve robustness to the relationship between the
learning rate and the Lipschitz constant, and near-optimal convergence rates in
both the batch and stochastic settings ($O(1/T)$ for smooth loss in the batch
setting, and $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for convex loss in the stochastic setting). We
also show through numerical evidence that such robustness of the proposed
method extends to highly nonconvex and possibly non-smooth loss function in
deep learning problems.Our analysis establishes some first theoretical
understanding into the observed robustness for batch normalization and weight
normalization.

Title: DeepCAS: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Control-Aware
  Scheduling
Authors: Burak Demirel, Arunselvan Ramaswamy, Daniel E. Quevedo and Holger Karl
Categories: cs.SY cs.AI
\\
  We consider networked control systems consisting of multiple independent
closed-loop control subsystems, operating over a shared communication network.
Such systems are ubiquitous in cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, and
large-scale industrial systems. In many large-scale settings, the size of the
communication network is smaller than the size of the system. In consequence,
scheduling issues arise. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a
deep reinforcement learning-based \emph{control-aware} scheduling
(\textsc{DeepCAS}) algorithm to tackle these issues. We use the following
(optimal) design strategy: First, we synthesize an optimal controller for each
subsystem; next, we design learning algorithm that adapts to the chosen
subsystem (plant) and controller. As a consequence of this adaptation, our
algorithm finds a schedule that minimizes the \emph{control loss}. We present
empirical results to show that \textsc{DeepCAS} finds schedules with better
performance than periodic ones. Finally, we illustrate that our algorithm can
be used for \emph{scheduling and resource allocation in more general networked
control settings than the above-mentioned one}.

\\
  Designing RNA sequences that fold into specific structures and perform
desired biological functions is an emerging field in bioengineering with broad
applications from intracellular chemical catalysis to cancer therapy via
selective gene silencing. Effective RNA design requires first solving the
inverse folding problem: given a target structure, propose a sequence that
folds into that structure. Although significant progress has been made in
developing computational algorithms for this purpose, current approaches are
ineffective at designing sequences for complex targets, limiting their utility
in real-world applications. However, an alternative that has shown
significantly higher performance are human players of the online RNA design
game EteRNA. Through many rounds of gameplay, these players have developed a
collective library of "human" rules and strategies for RNA design that have
proven to be more effective than current computational approaches, especially
for complex targets. Here, we present an RNA design agent, SentRNA, which
consists of a fully-connected neural network trained using the $eternasolves$
dataset, a set of $1.8 x 10^4$ player-submitted sequences across 724 unique
targets. The agent first predicts an initial sequence for a target using the
trained network, and then refines that solution if necessary using a short
adaptive walk utilizing a canon of standard design moves. Through this
approach, we observe SentRNA can learn and apply human-like design strategies
to solve several complex targets previously unsolvable by any computational
approach. We thus demonstrate that incorporating a prior of human design
strategies into a computational agent can significantly boost its performance,
and suggests a new paradigm for machine-based RNA design.

Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures, submitted for review to Automatica
\\
  Quantifying similarity between data objects is an important part of modern
data science. Deciding what similarity measure to use is very application
dependent. In this paper, we combine insights from systems theory and machine
learning, and investigate the weighted cepstral distance, which was previously
defined for signals coming from ARMA models. We provide an extension of this
distance to invertible deterministic linear time invariant single input single
output models, and assess its applicability. We show that it can always be
interpreted in terms of the poles and zeros of the underlying model, and that,
in the case of stable, minimum-phase, or unstable, maximum-phase models, a
geometrical interpretation in terms of subspace angles can be given. We then
devise a method to assess stability and phase-type of the generating models,
using only input/output signal information. In this way, we prove a connection
between the extended weighted cepstral distance and a weighted cepstral model
norm. In this way, we provide a purely data-driven way to assess different
underlying dynamics of input/output signal pairs, without the need for any
system identification step. This can be useful in machine learning tasks such
as time series clustering. An iPython tutorial is published complementary to
this paper, containing implementations of the various methods and algorithms
presented here, as well as some numerical illustrations of the equivalences
proven here.

  In Codice Ratio is a research project to study tools and techniques for

paleographers with a tool to reduce their efforts in transcribing large

significant portions of the manuscripts. We propose an original approach based
on character segmentation. Our solution is able to deal with the dirty
segmentation that inevitably occurs in handwritten documents. We use a
convolutional neural network to recognize characters and language models to
compose word transcriptions. Our approach requires minimal training efforts,
making the transcription process more scalable as the production of training
sets requires a few pages and can be easily crowdsourced. We have conducted
experiments on manuscripts from the Vatican Registers, an unreleased corpus
containing the correspondence of the popes. With training data produced by 120
high school students, our system has been able to produce good transcriptions
that can be used by paleographers as a solid basis to speedup the transcription
process at a large scale.

  We present semi-supervised deep learning approaches for traversability
estimation from fisheye images. Our method, GONet, and the proposed extensions
leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively predict whether
the area seen in the input image(s) is safe for a robot to traverse. These
methods are trained with many positive images of traversable places, but just a
small set of negative images depicting blocked and unsafe areas. This makes the
proposed methods practical. Positive examples can be collected easily by simply
operating a robot through traversable spaces, while obtaining negative examples
is time consuming, costly, and potentially dangerous. Through extensive
experiments and several demonstrations, we show that the proposed
traversability estimation approaches are robust and can generalize to unseen
scenarios. Further, we demonstrate that our methods are memory efficient and
fast, allowing for real-time operation on a mobile robot with single or stereo
fisheye cameras. As part of our contributions, we open-source two new datasets
for traversability estimation. These datasets are composed of approximately 24h
of videos from more than 25 indoor environments. Our methods outperform
baseline approaches for traversability estimation on these new datasets.

  In this paper, we examine the recent trend towards in-browser mining of
cryptocurrencies; in particular, the mining of Monero through Coinhive and
similar code- bases. In this model, a user visiting a website will download a
JavaScript code that executes client-side in her browser, mines a
cryptocurrency, typically without her consent or knowledge, and pays out the
seigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ this as an
alternative or to supplement advertisement revenue, may offer premium content
in exchange for mining, or may be unwittingly serving the code as a result of a
breach (in which case the seigniorage is collected by the attacker). The
cryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its unfriendliness to
large-scale ASIC mining that would drive browser-based efforts out of the
market, as well as for its purported privacy features. In this paper, we survey
this landscape, conduct some measurements to establish its prevalence and

  In the real time processing, a new emerging technology where the need of
connecting smart devices with cloud through Internet has raised. IoT devices
processed information is to be stored and accessed anywhere needed with a
support of powerful computing performance, efficient storage infrastructure for
heterogeneous systems and software which configures and controls these
different devices. A lot of challenges to be addressed are listed with this new
emerging technology as it needs to be compatible with the upcoming 5G wireless
devices too. In this paper, the benefits and challenges of this innovative
paradigm along with the areas open to do research are shown.

Title: Deep Models of Interactions Across Sets
Authors: Jason Hartford, Devon R Graham, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Siamak Ravanbakhsh
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We use deep learning to model interactions across two or more sets of
objects, such as user-movie ratings or protein-drug bindings. The canonical
representation of such interactions is a matrix (or tensor) with an
exchangeability property: the encoding's meaning is not changed by permuting
rows or columns. We argue that models should hence be Permutation Equivariant
(PE): constrained to make the same predictions across such permutations. We
present a parameter-sharing scheme and prove that it could not be made any more
expressive without violating PE. This scheme yields three benefits. First, we
demonstrate performance competitive with the state of the art on multiple
matrix completion benchmarks. Second, our models require a number of parameters
independent of the numbers of objects, and thus scale well to large datasets.
Third, models can be queried about new objects that were not available at
training time, but for which interactions have since been observed. We observed
surprisingly good generalization performance on this matrix extrapolation task,
both within domains (e.g., new users and new movies drawn from the same
distribution used for training) and even across domains (e.g., predicting music
ratings after training on movie ratings).

Title: Fast Convergence for Stochastic and Distributed Gradient Descent in the
  Interpolation Limit
Authors: Partha P Mitra
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to EUSIPCO 2018
\\
  Modern supervised learning techniques, particularly those using so called
deep nets, involve fitting high dimensional labelled data sets with functions
containing very large numbers of parameters. Much of this work is empirical,
and interesting phenomena have been observed that require theoretical
explanations, however the non-convexity of the loss functions complicates the
analysis. Recently it has been proposed that some of the success of these
techniques resides in the effectiveness of the simple stochastic gradient
descent algorithm in the so called interpolation limit in which all labels are
fit perfectly. This analysis is made possible since the SGD algorithm reduces
to a stochastic linear system near the interpolating minimum of the loss
function. Here we exploit this insight by analyzing a distributed algorithm for
gradient descent, also in the interpolating limit. The algorithm corresponds to
gradient descent applied to a simple penalized distributed loss function,
$L({\bf w}_1,...,{\bf w}_n) = \Sigma_i l_i({\bf w}_i) + \mu \sum_{<i,j>}|{\bf
w}_i-{\bf w}_j|^2$. Here each node is allowed its own parameter vector and
$<i,j>$ denotes edges of a connected graph defining the communication links
between nodes. It is shown that this distributed algorithm converges linearly
(ie the error reduces exponentially with iteration number), with a rate
$1-\frac{\eta}{n}\lambda_{min}(H)<R<1$ where $\lambda_{min}(H)$ is the smallest
nonzero eigenvalue of the sample covariance or the Hessian H. In contrast with
previous usage of similar penalty functions to enforce consensus between nodes,
in the interpolating limit it is not required to take the penalty parameter to
infinity for consensus to occur. The analysis further reinforces the utility of
this limit in the theoretical treatment of modern machine learning algorithms.

Title: Design of a nickel-base superalloy using a neural network
Authors: B.D. Conduit, N.G. Jones, H.J. Stone, and G.J. Conduit
Categories: cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG physics.comp-ph
Journal-ref: Materials & Design 131, 358 (2017)
\\
  A new computational tool has been developed to model, discover, and optimize
new alloys that simultaneously satisfy up to eleven physical criteria. An
artificial neural network is trained from pre-existing materials data that
enables the prediction of individual material properties both as a function of
composition and heat treatment routine, which allows it to optimize the
material properties to search for the material with properties most likely to
exceed a target criteria. We design a new polycrystalline nickel-base
superalloy with the optimal combination of cost, density, gamma' phase content
and solvus, phase stability, fatigue life, yield stress, ultimate tensile
strength, stress rupture, oxidation resistance, and tensile elongation.
Experimental data demonstrates that the proposed alloy fulfills the
computational predictions, possessing multiple physical properties,
particularly oxidation resistance and yield stress, that exceed existing
commercially available alloys.

Title: Physical Layer Communications System Design Over-the-Air Using
  Adversarial Networks
Authors: Timothy J. O'Shea, Tamoghna Roy, Nathan West, Benjamin C. Hilburn
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  This paper presents a novel method for synthesizing new physical layer
modulation and coding schemes for communications systems using a learning-based
approach which does not require an analytic model of the impairments in the
channel. It extends prior work published on the channel autoencoder to consider
the case where the channel response is not known or can not be easily modeled
in a closed form analytic expression. By adopting an adversarial approach for
channel response approximation and information encoding, we can jointly learn a
good solution to both tasks over a wide range of channel environments. We
describe the operation of the proposed adversarial system, share results for
its training and validation over-the-air, and discuss implications and future
work in the area.

Title: Drug Recommendation toward Safe Polypharmacy
Authors: Wen-Hao Chiang, Li Shen, Lang Li and Xia Ning
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) induced from high-order drug-drug interactions
(DDIs) due to polypharmacy represent a significant public health problem. In
this paper, we formally formulate the to-avoid and safe (with respect to ADRs)
drug recommendation problems when multiple drugs have been taken
simultaneously. We develop a joint model with a recommendation component and an
ADR label prediction component to recommend for a prescription a set of
to-avoid drugs that will induce ADRs if taken together with the prescription.
We also develop real drug-drug interaction datasets and corresponding
evaluation protocols. Our experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the
strong performance of the joint model compared to other baseline methods.

Title: A Bayesian and Machine Learning approach to estimating Influence Model
  parameters for IM-RO
Authors: Trisha Lawrence
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  The rise of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has caused an insurmountable amount
of interest from advertisers and researchers seeking to monopolize on its
features. Researchers aim to develop strategies for determining how information
is propagated among users within an OSN that is captured by diffusion or
influence models. We consider the influence models for the IM-RO problem, a
novel formulation to the Influence Maximization (IM) problem based on
implementing Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP). In contrast to existing
approaches involving influence spread and the theory of submodular functions,
the SDP method focuses on optimizing clicks and ultimately revenue to
advertisers in OSNs. Existing approaches to influence maximization have been
actively researched over the past decade, with applications to multiple fields,
however, our approach is a more practical variant to the original IM problem.
In this paper, we provide an analysis on the influence models of the IM-RO
problem by conducting experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. We
propose a Bayesian and Machine Learning approach for estimating the parameters
of the influence models for the (Influence Maximization- Revenue Optimization)
IM-RO problem. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model and implement the
well-known Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Decision Trees classifier (DTC) and
Random Forest classifier (RFC) on three real-world datasets. Compared to
previous approaches to estimating influence model parameters, our strategy has
the great advantage of being directly implementable in standard software
packages such as WinBUGS/OpenBUGS/JAGS and Apache Spark. We demonstrate the
efficiency and usability of our methods in terms of spreading information and
generating revenue for advertisers in the context of OSNs.

Title: Improving Optimization in Models With Continuous Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Robert Bamler and Stephan Mandt
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages + references, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Many loss functions in representation learning are invariant under a
continuous symmetry transformation. As an example, consider word embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013), where the loss remains unchanged if we simultaneously
rotate all word and context embedding vectors. We show that representation
learning models with a continuous symmetry and a quadratic Markovian time
series prior possess so-called Goldstone modes. These are low cost deviations
from the optimum which slow down convergence of gradient descent. We use tools
from gauge theory in physics to design an optimization algorithm that solves
the slow convergence problem. Our algorithm leads to a fast decay of Goldstone
modes, to orders of magnitude faster convergence, and to more interpretable
representations, as we show for dynamic extensions of matrix factorization and
word embedding models. We present an example application, translating modern
words into historic language using a shared representation space.
